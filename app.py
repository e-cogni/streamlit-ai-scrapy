# AI Image Generation and Vision Demos

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Welcome to the [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai) demo apps.

These demos are built in [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

I want you to explore and play with what is possible. You have to see this stuff to to believe it.

ðŸ‘ˆ Choose from the demos here on the left

In **Prompting**, you'll get to create a realistic image using our [current models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/). (We're always adding more!)
You'll also receive handy tips on how to make your prompting better.

In **Masking**, you'll be able to use a canvas to replace portions of an image with new generated images.

In **Seeing**, you can upload a photo and ask questions about it.
